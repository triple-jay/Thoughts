### Features
Current features:
* Create an account by sign-up with email and login at any time
* Post your own messages and react to others' messages with a like/dislike
* Filter for messages by search
* Change your username and pick a profile picture for other users to see

Future ideas:
* Create a way to reply to others' messages
* Create an interface to allow people to direct message users
* Improve UI/UX design

### Development
Used Swift 5 and Xcode for development. Used Google Firebase for authentication, storage, and backend.

### Future updates
As of now, this project has been halted in favor of an app I have been developing, CashPal, which is now live on the App Store: https://www.tinyurl.com/downloadcashpal. If I continue this project, I will push new updates to this repository.
